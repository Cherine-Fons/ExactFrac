# ExactFrac Oracle Catalog

Hand-derived mathematical truth cases for ExactFrac.

Every expected result in this catalog is derived independently before implementation
code is allowed to compute it. Implementations may later cross-check these cases, but
implementation output is never used to establish an oracle answer.

## Oracle classifications

- `GLOBAL_ORACLE` — proved exact optimum of the complete compact problem.
- `BRANCH_ORACLE` — proved expected value or output for one specified branch.
- `LOCAL_CONTRACT_FIXTURE` — proved local construction or lower-bound witness; not
  automatically a global optimum.
- `CROSS_MODEL_EQUIVALENCE` — compact and expanded-copy formulations proved to agree.
- `NEGATIVE` — rejected or unsupported input, or an infeasible mathematical object.

## ORACLE-001 — Q = 1 single-edge empty family

**Classification:** `GLOBAL_ORACLE`

**Source obligation:** `lem:empty`

### Instance

Let

$$
V=\{0,1\},
\qquad
S=\{\{0,1\}\},
\qquad
q_{01}=1,
\qquad
f=(1,1).
$$

The total multiplicity is

$$
Q=1.
$$

The multiplicity-weighted degrees are

$$
d_q(0)=d_q(1)=1.
$$

Therefore the active hypothesis holds:

$$
f(v)\le d_q(v)
\qquad
\text{for every }v\in V.
$$

Thus this is a valid active ExactFrac instance. The expected `Empty` result below is
not caused by invalid or unsupported input.

### Independent derivation

The nonempty shores are

$$
\{0\},
\qquad
\{1\},
\qquad
\{0,1\}.
$$

#### Shore $U=\{0\}$

The unique support edge crosses the boundary, so the compact boundary count satisfies

$$
y_{01}\in\{0,1\}.
$$

If

$$
y_{01}=0,
$$

then

$$
f(U)+Y(y)=1.
$$

This total is odd, but it fails the admissibility lower bound

$$
f(U)+Y(y)\ge3.
$$

If

$$
y_{01}=1,
$$

then

$$
f(U)+Y(y)=2.
$$

This total is even and also below $3$.

Therefore no admissible compact pair uses

$$
U=\{0\}.
$$

#### Shore $U=\{1\}$

This case is symmetric to $U=\{0\}$.

Again,

$$
y_{01}\in\{0,1\},
$$

and the corresponding totals are $1$ and $2$.

Neither choice satisfies all admissibility conditions.

Therefore no admissible compact pair uses

$$
U=\{1\}.
$$

#### Shore $U=\{0,1\}$

The unique support edge is internal, so the boundary is empty.

Therefore necessarily

$$
Y(y)=0.
$$

Also,

$$
f(U)=f(0)+f(1)=2.
$$

Hence

$$
f(U)+Y(y)=2.
$$

This total is even and below $3$.

Therefore no admissible compact pair uses

$$
U=\{0,1\}.
$$

### Conclusion

Every nonempty shore has been exhausted.

Therefore

$$
\mathcal A_q(H)=\varnothing.
$$

The exact global output is

$$
\boxed{((0,1),\mathrm{Empty})}.
$$

### Machine-facing expected result

- `value = (0, 1)`
- `witness = Empty`

### Interpretation

The instance is valid and satisfies the active hypothesis.

`Empty` therefore represents a legitimate mathematical solution state:

- valid active instance;
- admissible family empty;
- return `((0,1), Empty)`.

This is fundamentally different from an invalid or out-of-regime instance:

- invalid or unsupported instance;
- reject the instance.

The implementation must never conflate these two cases.

### What this oracle protects

This oracle checks that an implementation correctly handles:

1. the active hypothesis;
2. compact boundary multiplicity rather than indivisible edge weight;
3. the parity admissibility condition;
4. the lower bound $f(U)+Y(y)\ge3$;
5. exhaustive treatment of all nonempty shores;
6. the empty-family output contract `((0,1), Empty)`;
7. the distinction between invalid input and a valid instance with an empty admissible
   family;
8. the requirement that no dummy shore or dummy $y$-vector is manufactured when the
   admissible family is empty.

### Oracle status

**Hand-derived before implementation.**

No solver, brute-force verifier, branch oracle, or other implementation output was used
to establish this result.
